      title: 'STB 82.5 MD in net profit in 2024 despite a 5.2% decrease in GNP',
      content: `The Tunisian Banking Company (STB), a state-owned institution, closed 2024 with a net profit of 82.5 million dinars, despite a decline in profitability and auditor concerns over loan guarantee management.

Auditors flagged the lack of a reliable guarantee database and noted that real guarantees (~2.38 billion dinars) are missing from off-balance-sheet commitments, while total loan guarantees were estimated at 3.016 billion dinars.

Financially, STB saw a 5.2% drop in net banking income to 649.7 million dinars, due to a decline in banking operating income. Net loans fell by 7.1%, and borrowings dropped by 11.9%, but customer deposits increased by 12%, totaling 11.4 billion dinars.

A tax audit covering 2019â€“2020 led to an initial adjustment of 61.9 million dinars, later settled for 23.4 million following a tax amnesty. The board will propose no dividend distribution for 2024 at the April 2025 general meeting.

Founded in 1957, STB is 83.3% state-owned and has a capital of 776.9 million dinars.`,
